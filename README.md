Rules of the game
- There are ten total rounds each game with each round consisting of three possible rolls.
- Each round, the player starts by rolling all four dice. The player can then choose to re-roll any number of dice up to two times for a better hand. 
- At the end of three (or 1 or 2) rolls, the player must choose to enter a score into the scorecard that fit the constraints of a particular category (ex Three of a Kind or Threes).
- The player’s end score is the sum of the scores in all categories. Only one score can be entered into a particular category, and scores may not be removed once entered. 
- If the roll at the end of the round cannot be inserted into the scorecard, then the player does not gain any points for that round. 
- The object of the game is to get the highest number of points possible and beat the computer player.
